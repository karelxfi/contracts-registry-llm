This directory contains configuration and guidelines for Claude AI when working with the Contracts Registry project.

## Files

- **CONFIG.md** - Comprehensive project configuration with rules, principles, and best practices
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference guide for common operations and commands

## Purpose

These configuration files help maintain:
- **Data integrity** - Ensuring addresses and contract data are accurate
- **Consistency** - Following established patterns and conventions
- **Quality** - Proper verification and testing before commits
- **Efficiency** - Quick access to common operations and templates

## For Human Developers

These guides are optimized for AI assistants but are also useful for human developers working on the project. They document:
- Project structure and conventions
- Common workflows and operations
- Data validation requirements
- Git workflow best practices

## Quick Start

1. Read `CONFIG.md` for comprehensive project overview
2. Use `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for quick operation templates
3. Always run `npm run build` after source file changes
4. Verify changes before pushing

## Key Principles

1. **Build before commit** - Generated files must be in sync
2. **Verify addresses** - Cross-reference with official sources
3. **Document sources** - Always cite where data came from
4. **Test locally** - Check generated files before pushing
